## EnderV3 KE PrusaSlicer Profiles
As a seasoned 3D printer enthusiast, I love my EnderV3 KE for numerous reasons.

I did my best to mimic CrealitySlicer's settings into PrusaSlicer Profiles. 

I took an export of a PrusaSlicer's config bundle, then seperated out each profile and organized them into seperate files as you see in this repo. 

I hope the community can help tune these to perfection!

### How to Use
1. Download the config files of your choice from the repo
2. In PrusaSlicer, go to **File -> Import -> Import Config Bundle** for each file
